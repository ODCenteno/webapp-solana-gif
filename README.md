# Welcome to my first Solana Web3 App Project

Learning by doing the project launched at Buildspace.

This is a very nice and cool async, weeklong project for curious devs that want to hack around with Solana. You'll pick up some Rust, write + deploy a Solana program, and connect it all back to a React web3 app that anyone with a Solana wallet will be able to interact with!
